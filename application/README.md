# Application Folder

## Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to store all the source code and related files for your team's application. Source code MUST NOT be in any of folder. <strong>YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</strong>

You are free to organize the contents of the folder as you see fit. But remember your team is graded on how you use Git. This does include the structure of your application. Points will be deducted from poorly structured application folders.

## Please use the rest of the README.md to store important information for your team's application.

## Team comments start here:
NOTE: I am sure all of you knows this but just reitrating.
Never ever ever ever commit node_modules. I have already listed it in .gitignore



This is a starter code for CSC 648 Project Development.
This application uses express boilerplate code by @jpotts18 link: https://github.com/jpotts18/mean-stack-relational. This is an opensourse code available on github. Free licence is included in LICENCE file.
This starter code uses Bower for frontend packages and grunt for unit testing. So before anything install bower and grunt.

Install WAMP(for Windows) MAMP(for MAC maybe) server for easy access to Mysql. Then import the dbmediastore.sql file into database. "Let me know if you need help".

Tip: make sure you have grunt and bower installed globally i.e. npm install -g bower and npm install -g grunt.

Happy Coding!
